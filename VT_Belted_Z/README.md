This is a belted Z mod candidate for the Voron Trident.  It use three modified V2.4 Z drives in place of the integrated leadscrew steppers for Z motion.  

Parts are currently designed for 9mm belts, but 6mm belts could be used by swapping to a 6mm pulley and adding extra spacers around the idler bearings.
